# 🍽️ Zomato Restaurant Data Analysis

This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Zomato restaurant data using Python. The goal is to extract meaningful insights about restaurants, cuisines, ratings, votes, and more, using visualization and data manipulation techniques.

## 📌 Features

- Cleaned and preprocessed Zomato dataset
- Visualized rating distributions and vote counts
- Analyzed restaurant types and popular cuisines
- Barplots, pointplots, and other visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Grouping and aggregation of data for deeper insights

## 📊 Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 📁 Files

- `zomato.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the entire analysis and visualization.
- `README.md`: Project overview and usage guide.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/zomato-data-analysis.git
   cd zomato-data-analysis
````

2. Install dependencies:
